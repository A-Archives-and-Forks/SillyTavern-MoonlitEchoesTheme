**Moonlit Echoes Êúà‰∏ãÂõûËÅ≤** is a UI theme designed for SillyTavern. It has been customized and refined based on my personal preferences to create a more modern, elegant, and minimalist interface while enhancing the user experience across both desktop and mobile platforms.

Moonlit Echoes was first released on the SillyTavern Discord server on November 25, 2024, and has been continuously updated with valuable feedback and support from the community. Eventually, to improve maintainability and ease of updates‚Äîand to satisfy my obsession with well-designed themes‚ÄîI developed this as a SillyTavern extension and made it open-source on GitHub.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
It is recommended to use the **latest version** of SillyTavern (either Release or Staging) along with Google Chrome.

## Installation Steps

### 1. **Install Moonlit Echoes Theme**
In the **SillyTavern Extension Manager**, use "Install from URL" and paste the following Git URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/RivelleDays/SillyTavern-MoonlitEchoesTheme
   ```

### 2. **Update to `/SillyTavern/config.yaml` for thumbnail settings**
Previously, I recommended disabling thumbnails, but this can slow down image loading on mobile. Here‚Äôs a tested configuration I now recommend:
   ```
   thumbnails:
     thumbnails:
        enabled: true
        format: png
        quality: 100
        dimensions:
          bg:
            - 240
            - 135
          avatar:
            - 864
            - 1280
   ```
Before applying and restarting SillyTavern, consider deleting the entire thumbnails folder (likely located at `/SillyTavern/data/default-user/thumbnails`) Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit will regenerate automatically with better image quality after restart.

### 3. **Download and Enable the Theme (Highly Recommended!)**

The Moonlit Echoes theme extension is ready to use after installation. However, if you‚Äôd like your interface to match the style shown in the preview images, please download the theme file and import it into your User Settings, then set it as your UI theme.

The newly added **‚ÄúGlimmerÔºàÂæÆÂÖâÔºâ‚Äù** theme in version 2.5.0 is especially recommended. This theme was specially designed for this release‚Äîminimalist, versatile, and perfect for using your phone under the covers at night.
You can find it in the GitHub theme folder or download it directly below:

- [Glimmer - by Rivelle.json](https://github.com/RivelleDays/SillyTavern-MoonlitEchoesTheme/blob/main/theme/Glimmer%20-%20by%20Rivelle.json) ‚Üí for SillyTavern User Settings
- [[Moonlit] Glimmer - by Rivelle.json](https://github.com/RivelleDays/SillyTavern-MoonlitEchoesTheme/blob/main/theme/%5BMoonlit%5D%20Glimmer%20-%20by%20Rivelle.json) ‚Üí for Moonlit Echoes Theme Presets

No need to tweak anything‚Äîjust drop the file in and you‚Äôre good to go!

## For SillyTavern Users via Termux üì±
If you‚Äôre using SillyTavern via Termux, here‚Äôs how you can modify `config.yaml`.

> [!Warning]
> I don‚Äôt have experience with Android devices or Termux, so I can‚Äôt answer related questions, test the steps, or guarantee results. The following methods are provided by other users.

> [!NOTE]
> You may find two config.yaml files inside the SillyTavern folder. Make sure to edit the one in the root directory: `/SillyTavern/config.yaml.` **Do NOT modify** `/SillyTavern/default/config.yaml` or anything inside the default folder.

### Method 1: Edit via Termux
1. Open Termux and enter: `cd SillyTavern`
2. Then, run: `nano config.yaml` to edit the file.

### Method 2: Use Material Files (Android File Manager)
1. **Open Material Files** > **Add Storage** > **Navigate to Termux** > **SillyTavern**
2. Within the SillyTavern directory, edit `config.yaml` directly

# Usage Guide

## How to Use the Moonlit Echoes Theme Preset?
The Moonlit Echoes theme preset is partially synced with the UI themes in SillyTavern. If there are matching options in the menu, switching either one will sync the settings accordingly.

However, the Moonlit Echoes theme preset is fundamentally separate from SillyTavern‚Äôs UI themes. The Moonlit Echoes Theme does NOT create or modify any SillyTavern UI themes.

### Import & Export
- Moonlit Echoes theme preset files follow the format `[Moonlit] PresetName.json` (e.g., `[Moonlit] Honey Cream.json`). There is a half-width space after `[Moonlit]`
- This does not affect functionality. You do **NOT** need to remove `[Moonlit] ` before importing‚Äîjust import the file directly
- If the imported preset does not sync with SillyTavern UI themes, **reload the page** or **select a different theme** to apply the changes

## FAQ

### Q: The layout looks broken or doesn‚Äôt work with other extensions?
**A:** Yes, despite my best efforts, I can‚Äôt guarantee full compatibility with every third-party SillyTavern extension. If you run into any issues, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of SillyTavern with the latest version of Chrome.  
2. Temporarily disable this theme extension to check whether it‚Äôs the cause.  
   If it is‚Äîor if the third-party extension you're using isn't supported yet‚Äîfeel free to report it.

Moonlit Echoes is a third-party theme extension and is not affiliated with the official SillyTavern project. It‚Äôs a personal project born out of love for SillyTavern and a strong preference for visual design. If you encounter any issues, please reach out to me first‚ÄîI‚Äôll do my best to help.

### Q: What other extensions are you using in the preview images?
**A:** Here are the extensions I highly recommend and can confirm are fully supported by Moonlit Echoes:
- **[SillyTavern / Extension-TopInfoBar](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TopInfoBar)**: Official extension. Lets you quickly switch chats, jump between files, and search messages. My absolute favorite‚Äîhighly recommended!
- **[SillyTavern / Extension-QuickPersona](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-QuickPersona)**: Official extension. Easily switch personas from the chat input area, with stylish visual cues.
- **[SillyTavern / Extension-TypingIndicator](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TypingIndicator)**: Official extension. Shows a cute `{{char}} is typing...` indicator while characters are responding.
- **[zerofata / SillyTavern-Dialogue-Colorizer-Plus](https://github.com/zerofata/SillyTavern-Dialogue-Colorizer-Plus)**: A fork of the original [SillyTavern-Dialogue-Colorizer](https://github.com/XanadusWorks/SillyTavern-Dialogue-Colorizer), with improved variable support for customizing character dialogue colors.
- **[qvink / SillyTavern-MessageSummarize](https://github.com/qvink/SillyTavern-MessageSummarize)**: Adds smart summarization to simulate long- and short-term memory for LLMs‚Äîvery powerful and useful.
- **[LenAnderson / SillyTavern-MoreFlexibleContinues](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-MoreFlexibleContinues/)**: Adds more flexibility to continue generations and enables quick message edits.
- **[splitclover / rewrite-extension](https://github.com/splitclover/rewrite-extension)**: Allows fast partial rewrites and deletions of message content.

### Q: Experiencing a lag when switching themes with Moonlit Echoes?
**A:** Yes, this is a known issue I haven‚Äôt been able to resolve yet. On mobile, the switch may freeze briefly for a few seconds before completing. Just wait a moment and it should load fine. This rarely happens on desktop.
